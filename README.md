# SQL Queries

## Background

Six CSV files observed to research employees of a given corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. Data Modeling, Data Engineering & Data Analysis completed to organize data and query employee information by specified quota.  Queries executed in pgAdmin, a popular management tool for PostgreSQL.

## Data Modeling

Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) structured to illustrate the correlations among six csv files.

## Data Engineering

Table schemas created for each CSV file. Data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints identified.  CSV files imported into the corresponding SQL tables.
